The main goal is to research the internals of the game *The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing*. I plan to reverse engineer interesting parts of the game and its file formats. Eventually, it may become useful for myself and other developers, or even end-users.\r\n\r\n## Download (binary, Windows)\r\nSee [releases on GitHub](https://github.com/SteffenL/Van-Helsing-game-research/releases).\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n- Operating system: Windows XP or later.\r\n\r\n## Current programs\r\n- Unpacker for N2PK packages (Files.N2PK). These files contain textures, models, etc.\r\n- Storage viewer (command line) (storage.sav). Displays all of the items you have in your storage.\r\n- Storage editor (GUI).\r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n![Storage Editor](images/screenshots/editor/storage.png)\r\n\r\n## Game-save location (PC)\r\n`Documents\\NeocoreGames\\Van Helsing\\SaveGame\\<number>`","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
