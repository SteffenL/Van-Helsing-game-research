{"name":"Van-helsing-game-research","tagline":"Just want to fiddle a bit with the game \"The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing\".","body":"Van Helsing game research\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nThis project was initiated for fun and learning. The goal is to research the internals of the game *The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing*. The idea is to reverse engineer interesting parts of the game and its file formats. Eventually, it may become useful for myself and other developers, or even end-users.\r\n\r\nResearch is currently done by myself, Steffen Andr√© Langnes. Please don't just take my work and claim it as your own. :)\r\n\r\nA few links for search engines:\r\n\r\n- [Dead Island Save Editor (DISE)](http://deadislandsaveeditor.steffenl.com/) - My main project, a game-save editor.\r\n- [\"Private\" blog](http://blog.steffenl.com/)\r\n\r\n## Current programs\r\n- Unpacker for N2PK packages (*Files.N2PK*). These files contain textures, models, etc.\r\n- Storage viewer (*storage.sav*). Displays all of the items you have in your storage.\r\n\r\n## Pages\r\n\r\n- [Keep the game running in the background](https://github.com/SteffenL/Van-Helsing-game-research/wiki/Keep-the-game-running-in-the-background)\r\n- [Skip logos on startup](https://github.com/SteffenL/Van-Helsing-game-research/wiki/Skip-logos-on-startup)\r\n- [Use the 32 bit version of the game on 64 bit systems](https://github.com/SteffenL/Van-Helsing-game-research/wiki/Use-the-32-bit-version-of-the-game-on-64-bit-systems)\r\n\r\n## Game-save location (PC)\r\n`Documents\\NeocoreGames\\Van Helsing\\SaveGame\\21801362`\r\n\r\n## Files\r\n\r\n- *.sav - Game-save/Character.\r\n- timestamp.hts\r\n- backup\\*.sav - Backup of old saves.\r\n- common\\storage.sav - Storage/Chest?\r\n- achievements.sav\r\n\r\n## Saves (and such) inside repo (for research)\r\n\r\nVery incomplete, but these files are the files I'm workong with *at the moment*.\r\n\r\n- bookmarks.hbk - Bookmarks for Hex Workshop. Use with `TestCrve_orig.sav` to locate interesting values.\r\n- TestCrve_orig.sav - The original (well, almost original) save. Revert `TestCrve.sav` to this one when needed.\r\n- TestCrve.sav - Modded save or whatever; should not really keep it in the repo.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
