The main goal is to research the internals of the game *The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing*. I plan to reverse engineer interesting parts of the game and its file formats. Eventually, it may become useful for myself and other developers, or even end-users.\r\n\r\nI with focus on extracting info and mainly do work related to the saves. Modding the game and creating proper game-save editors may not be too far away. :)\r\n\r\nResearch is currently done by myself, Steffen Andr√© Langnes. Please don't just take my work and claim it as your own. :)\r\n\r\nMy other project(s):\r\n\r\n- [Dead Island Save Editor (DISE)](http://deadislandsaveeditor.steffenl.com/) - My main project, a game-save editor.\r\n- [\"Private\" blog](http://blog.steffenl.com/)\r\n\r\n## Download (binary, Windows)\r\n[r20130606](http://www.mediafire.com/download/u175wdg7ha1b3if/storage_editor_20130606.zip)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n- Operating system: Windows XP or later.\r\n\r\n## Current programs\r\n- Unpacker for N2PK packages (Files.N2PK). These files contain textures, models, etc.\r\n- Storage viewer (command line) (storage.sav). Displays all of the items you have in your storage. (Replaced by GUI app, so this is useless now).\r\n- Storage editor (GUI).\r\n\r\n## Screenshot (2013-06-06)\r\n![Storage Editor](https://raw.github.com/wiki/SteffenL/Van-Helsing-game-research/images/mainwindow.png)\r\n\r\n## Pages\r\n\r\n- [Keep the game running in the background](https://github.com/SteffenL/Van-Helsing-game-research/wiki/Keep-the-game-running-in-the-background)\r\n- [Skip logos on startup](https://github.com/SteffenL/Van-Helsing-game-research/wiki/Skip-logos-on-startup)\r\n- [Use the 32 bit version of the game on 64 bit systems](https://github.com/SteffenL/Van-Helsing-game-research/wiki/Use-the-32-bit-version-of-the-game-on-64-bit-systems)\r\n- [List of items and IDs](https://github.com/SteffenL/Van-Helsing-game-research/wiki/List-of-items-and-IDs)\r\n- [List of enchantments and IDs](https://github.com/SteffenL/Van-Helsing-game-research/wiki/List-of-enchantments-and-IDs)\r\n\r\n## Game-save location (PC)\r\n`Documents\\NeocoreGames\\Van Helsing\\SaveGame\\21801362`\r\n\r\n## Files\r\n\r\n- *.sav - Game-save/Character.\r\n- timestamp.hts\r\n- backup\\*.sav - Backup of previous saves.\r\n- common\\storage.sav - Your own storage/chest.\r\n- achievements.sav","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
