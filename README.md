Van-Helsing-game-research
=========================

Just want to fiddle a bit with the game "The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing".

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/SteffenL/Van-Helsing-game-research/wiki) as well.

## About

Research is done by myself, Steffen Andr√© Langnes. I'm just doing this "research" for fun, and it might become something useful for myself and other developers, or end-users.

A few links for search engines:

- [Dead Island Save Editor (DISE)](http://deadislandsaveeditor.steffenl.com/)
- ["Private" blog](http://blog.steffenl.com/)

## Game-save location (PC)
`Documents\NeocoreGames\Van Helsing\SaveGame\21801362`

## Files

- *.sav - Game-save/Character.
- timestamp.hts
- backup\*.sav - Backup of old saves.
- common\storage.sav - Storage/Chest?
- achievements.sav

## Saves (and such) inside repo (for research)

Very incomplete, but these files are the files I'm workong with *at the moment*.

- bookmarks.hbk - Bookmarks for Hex Workshop. Use with `TestCrve_orig.sav` to locate interesting values.
- TestCrve_orig.sav - The original (well, almost original) save. Revert `TestCrve.sav` to this one when needed.
- TestCrve.sav - Modded save or whatever; should not really keep it in the repo.
